The model reproduces the temporal evolution of Glycogen phosphorylase for a
vale of Vm5=30 as depicted in Fig 1a of the paper. The model makes use of
calcium oscillations from the Borghans model to stimulate the activation of
glycogen phosphorylase. Hence, this is a simple extension of the Borghans
model. The model was succesfully tested on MathSBML and Jarnac.
